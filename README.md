# Zettelkasten

A personal Zettelkasten-style Obsidian vault for knowledge management, emphasizing atomic notes, lateral linking, and progressive processing of ideas.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00_Maps of Content` | High-level overview notes showing relationships between idea clusters |
| `10_Concepts` | Atomic ideas—one thought per note |
| `20_Thinkers` | Notes about people and their ideas |
| `30_Applications` | Practical applications of concepts |
| `40_Projects` | Active and backlogged projects |
| `50_Literature Notes` | Source-based notes with quotes and main points |
| `60_Permanent Notes` | Synthesized insights with connections |
| `70_Fleeting Notes` | Quick captures awaiting processing |
| `80_Templates` | Note templates and vault documentation |
| `99_Resources` | Supporting materials |
| `Daily Notes` | Daily journal entries with processing queue |

## Key Principles

- **Atomic notes**: One idea per note in `10_Concepts`
- **MOCs are maps, not summaries**: Link outward, don't explain concepts in depth
- **Literature notes are descriptive**: Synthesis belongs in Permanent Notes
- **Processing workflow**: Notes are "done" when linked, extracted to a permanent note, or refuted
