Claim:
Revolutionary spectacle risks becoming another commodity.

Core Idea:
Baudrillard critiques how images detach from reality, producing atmospheres of “resistance” that don’t challenge power. He warns that aesthetics—especially rebellious aesthetics—can be absorbed into the market and lose their edge.

Why it matters:
	•	Helps explain your discomfort with scenes defined by optics rather than solidarity.
	•	Illuminates how political imagery can be co-opted.
	•	Supports your preference for infrastructure-first politics, not vibes.
