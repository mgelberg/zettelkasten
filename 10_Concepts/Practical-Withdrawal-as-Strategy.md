### **Where Illich's Views Differ from [[Anarchism]]

1. **Less Emphasis on Direct Action & Revolution**:
    
    - Unlike anarchists such as [[Bakunin]] or [[Malatesta]], [[Ivan Illich]] did not advocate for **insurrection or revolution**. His approach was more about **opting out** of oppressive systems rather than actively dismantling them.
        
    - His method was closer to **cultural critique and withdrawal** rather than militant resistance.
        
2. **Not Explicitly Anti-State**:
    
    - While highly critical of **state bureaucracy**, Illich was not as explicitly **anti-statist** as most anarchists.
        
    - His focus was on the **culture of dependence** created by institutions rather than on **state power itself**.
        
3. **Christian Influence**:
    
    - Illich had a deep engagement with **Christian theology**, particularly in his ideas about hospitality, simplicity, and humility.
        
    - While some Christian anarchists (e.g., Tolstoy) share this perspective, many anarchists are more **materialist** and less influenced by religious thought.
