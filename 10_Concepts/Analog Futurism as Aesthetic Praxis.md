Claim:
The future should feel tactile, embodied, and human-scale.

Core Idea:
Analog futurism blends glitch, tactility, hand-built electronics, modular gear, video synthesis, and physical experimentation. It rejects sterile tech aesthetics and corporate futurism, grounding future-making in community craft and sensory experience.

Why it matters:
	•	Aligns your artistic sensibilities with your politics.
	•	Creates a cultural language that supports parallel institutions.
	•	Acts as a living critique of both capitalist futurism and nihilistic postmodernism.
	- It's something I'd like to see as something encouraged or celebrated with [[The Low Pass]]
