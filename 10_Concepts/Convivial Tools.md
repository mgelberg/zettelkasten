- In _Tools for Conviviality_ (1973), [[Ivan Illich]] proposed the idea of **convivial tools**—technologies and systems that enhance human autonomy and creativity rather than impose centralized control.
    
- He contrasted **convivial tools** with **industrial megastructures**, which alienate people from direct participation in their own well-being.
    
- This aligns with **anarchist critiques of industrial capitalism**, particularly those of Kropotkin and later eco-anarchists who advocate for decentralized, human-scaled technology.
