Claim:
Postmodern culture reflects and reinforces late capitalism’s surface-driven logic.

Core Idea:
Jameson argues that postmodernism replaces depth with surface, originality with pastiche, and critique with ironic recycling. It’s not just an art movement—it’s the aesthetic of neoliberal capitalism.

Why it matters:
	•	Clarifies why “abundance discourse” can feel shallow.
	•	Connects artistic aesthetics to political economy.
	•	Gives theoretical grounding to your anti-spectacular instincts.
