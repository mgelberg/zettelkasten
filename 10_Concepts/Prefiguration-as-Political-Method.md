Claim:
We should live the future directly, not postpone it until after upheaval or collapse.

Core Idea:
Prefiguration means the means must match the ends. A [[Cooperativism (Index)]], liberated society can only be built through cooperative, liberated practices now: co-ops, mutual aid, federated art scenes, community tech, and democratic governance in miniature.
This avoids the trap of “after the revolution…” authoritarianism and keeps political imagination grounded in our lived reality.

Why it matters:
	•	It’s the most ethical response to both capitalist damage and revolutionary violence.
	•	It builds material footholds that let people feel alternatives rather than theorize about them.
	•	It creates resilience and community power before crises hit.
