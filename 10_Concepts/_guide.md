**Purpose**:
Atomic ideas written in your own words.
This is the heart of the Zettelkasten.
Each represents a single thought.

Use when:
	•	An idea emerges from reading, thinking, or conversation
	•	You want to develop original insight
	•	You want to link concepts together laterally

Avoid:
	•	Summarizing sources (that belongs in Reading Notes)
	•	Stacking multiple ideas into one note
