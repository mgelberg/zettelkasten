Claim:
Metalabels echo anarchist affinity groups: small, mission-bound, reconfigurable.

Core Idea:
Metalabels—artist-owned, federated, event-driven collectives—mirror the anarchist idea of small groups formed for a specific purpose, dissolving when complete. They’re perfect for experimental music and analog futurism ecosystems.

Why it matters:
	•	Gives structure to your local community organizing.
	•	Offers a political rationale for creative group formation.
	•	Bridges anarchist history with contemporary practice.
