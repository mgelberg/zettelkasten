Claim:
Capitalist technology cloaks domination inside efficiency.

Core Idea:
[[Herbert Marcuse ]]argues that technology under capitalism becomes a kind of political reason—flattening dissent, narrowing imagination, and disguising hierarchy as “optimization.”
But he also insists that technology could be liberatory if reoriented toward eliminating unnecessary labor and expanding human freedom.

Why it matters:
	•	Helps distinguish liberatory vs repressive uses of AI.
	•	Explains why “innovation” discourse feels hollow.
	•	Offers grounding for your interest in community-owned tools.
