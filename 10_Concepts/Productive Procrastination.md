Gemini actually put this pretty well with regard to my [[Evernote migration]] questions, but I would consider it akin to [[Passive Learning]].

### 1. The "Sunk Cost" Trap

If you spend your next three weekends copy-pasting old notes from Evernote to Obsidian, you will feel busy, but you won't be doing the actual work of _thinking_. You’ll be doing data entry. You will burn out on the "practice" before you’ve even written a single new thought.

### 2. Most of it is Dead Weight

We tend to overestimate the value of our archives. If you haven't looked at a note in 2 years, it probably doesn't need to be in your active working memory (your Obsidian vault). Moving clutter from one room (Evernote) to another (Obsidian) just creates a messy new room.
