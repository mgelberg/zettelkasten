**Critique of Institutionalization**:

- [[Ivan Illich]] argued that modern institutions, rather than serving human needs, often become **self-perpetuating bureaucracies** that reinforce dependency and undermine autonomy.
    
- He famously criticized the **schooling system** in _Deschooling Society_ (1971), arguing that formal education does not foster real learning but instead conditions individuals to accept authority and hierarchy.
    
- His critique extended to medicine (_Medical Nemesis_), where he argued that institutionalized healthcare often creates more harm (iatrogenesis) than it prevents.


This would certianly lead to things like [[enshitification]]
