This is a format we've been using for [[The Low Pass]] events that has worked really well. We have access to the parsonage of the Calvary Church in West Philly, and we set up a different artist (so far we've maxed at 4) in different parts of the house. Then when the crowd has arrived (and really, we've had great crowds for this), they sit stand to catch the first artist, then move on together and the next artist follows within 5-10 minutes. It's fun, you can have people moving through the space as a group. I had the silly idea to use one of the mushroom lamps that we brought from home, and use it as a makeshift torch to light our way upstairs.

I think this is an ideal for the kind of space we can cultivate. The show on December 6 with the cellist and other talented female artists felit like a modern [[chamber music]] recital, where you had an intimate experience in what could be described as a salon.
