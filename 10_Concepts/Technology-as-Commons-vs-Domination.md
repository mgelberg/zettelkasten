Claim:
Technology is neutral; governance is not. Its political character comes from ownership.

Core Idea:
AI and digital tools shouldn’t be feared or worshipped. They should be owned in common, developed transparently, and governed democratically. The danger isn’t intelligence but enclosure: surveillance capitalism, opaque algorithms, platform monopolies.

Why it matters:
	•	Tools built for profit accelerate extraction.
	•	Tools built for care can reduce toil, free time, and expand capacity.
	•	It clarifies that tech pessimism is not political analysis.
