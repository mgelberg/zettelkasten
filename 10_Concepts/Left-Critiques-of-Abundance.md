**Claim:**
You support building more—but with structural clarity.

**Core Idea:**
Left critiques often reduce to “no abundance until capitalism ends,” but you reject that fatalism. You support ambitious public projects, renewable energy, new infrastructure—but with democratic control, worker power, and mutualist governance baked in.

**Why it matters:**
	•	Balances Klein’s optimism with Marxist structural analysis.
	•	Provides a middle path between techno-utopia and left pessimism.
	•	Grounds your thinking in actionable and material proposals.
