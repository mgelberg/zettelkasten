Claim:
The most effective political work is constructive.

Core Idea:
Parallel institutions (dual power): [[Cooperativism (Index)]] models, community compute centers, artist-run venues, credit unions, federated distribution networks. They coexist alongside capitalism, gradually replacing or outcompeting extractive systems.

Why it matters:
	•	It’s the practical expression of prefiguration.
	•	It avoids reliance on crisis or collapse.
	•	It’s the core of your political optimism.
