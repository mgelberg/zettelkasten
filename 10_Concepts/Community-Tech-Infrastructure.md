# **Community-Tech-Infrastructure**

_(Concept Zettel — 10-Concepts)_

## **Idea**

Community-Tech-Infrastructure refers to technological systems that are **owned, governed, and maintained by a local or intentional community**, rather than by corporate platforms. These systems prioritize **mutual support, autonomy, and cultural expression** over extraction, surveillance, and scale-at-all-costs. The infrastructure serves as a backbone for **prefigurative politics**: living future social relations now.

## **Why It Matters**

Mainstream tech platforms embed [[Technological-Rationality]]  that reinforces hierarchy, optimization for profit, and user passivity. Community-Tech-Infrastructure flips this by creating tools that reflect **local autonomy, analog-futurist aesthetics, mutualism, and artist-driven governance**. It becomes a practical alternative to corporate intermediaries — an infrastructure that strengthens relationships, not markets.

For the world of experimental music, video synthesis, and metalabels, this concept offers a technological foundation for **sustainable, non-competitive, artist-run ecosystems**.

## **Key Characteristics**

- **Owned & governed by the user community** ([[Cooperativism (Index)]] / mutualist governance).
    
- **Supports reciprocal, non-extractive participation** rather than metrics or competition.
    
- **Small-scale, modular, federated** rather than centralized.
    
- **Built for cultural expression**, not data capture.
    
- **Tech as convivial tool** ([[Ivan Illich]]): enabling autonomy, not dependence.
    
- **Aligns with [[Prefiguration]]**: infrastructure as political practice.
    
- **Low-stack when possible** (human-scale tools, not overbuilt platforms).
- 
- Welcomes [[Analog Futurism as Aesthetic Praxis]]: tactile, glitchy, imperfect, expressive.
    

## **Examples (Conceptual, Not Project-Specific)**

- A **community-governed CMS or event platform** for local artists (non-algorithmic discovery).
    
- A [[Metalabel (Index)]] operated toolset** for release coordination, documentation, and archiving.
    
- A **federated patronage system** built around mutualism instead of tiers or exclusivity.
    
- A **local-first communication network** (e.g., community Matrix instance, Signal groups, or peer-to-peer tools).
    
- A **cooperative digital library** for patches, stems, generative graphics, zines, and knowledge.
    
- A **shared analytics tool** that _artists own the data for_, not a third party.
    
- A **hardware-leaning, analog-friendly maker space** where tech + art blend (aligning with analog futurism).
    

## **Connections to Your Other Concepts**

- [[Mutualism (Index)]] — the economic and relational ethic this infrastructure embodies.
    
- [[Cooperativism (Index)]] — governance model for managing the infrastructure.
    
- [[Metalabels-as-Affinity-Groups]] — the social unit that would operate the system.
    
- [[Technology-as-Commons-vs-Domination]] — theoretical foundation for choosing this model.
    
- [[Illich-and-Convivial-Tools]] — philosophical grounding for community-scale tech.
    
- [[Analog Futurism as Aesthetic Praxis]] — why the “look and feel” matters as political expression.
    
- [[Building-Parallel-Institutions]] — infrastructure as real-time institution building.
    

## **Open Questions / Lines of Inquiry**

- What governance models best support small artist communities?
- How do we ensure _long-term stewardship_ without burnout?
- What forms of federation support autonomy without isolation? 
- What minimal viable tech stack supports the ethics behind this concept?
