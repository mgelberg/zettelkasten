Claim:
Creative work thrives under reciprocity, not competition.

Core Idea:
Mutualism offers artists a way out of scarcity logic: shared infrastructure, federated networks, [[Cooperativism (Index)]] ownership, transparent governance, and redistribution based on use rather than capital.
This is the antidote to both extractive platforms and the weird competitive energy that can plague small creative scenes.

Why it matters:
	•	Artists get time, tools, and security without gatekeepers.
	•	Scenes stop hoarding opportunities and start amplifying each other.
	•	It provides a real alternative to neoliberal “creator economy” fantasies.
