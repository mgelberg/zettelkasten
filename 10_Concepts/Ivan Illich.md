# Ivan Illich

## Overview
Ivan Illich (1926–2002) was a social critic who challenged the dominance of large-scale institutions—schools, hospitals, transportation systems, and bureaucratic services—and argued for “convivial tools”: technologies and systems that enhance autonomy, competence, and community self-governance. His work bridges anarchism, critique of industrial society, and design ethics, making him a crucial figure for thinking about alternative infrastructures.

## Key Ideas
- [[Convivial Tools]]
- [[Practical-Withdrawal-as-Strategy]]
- [[Institutional-Monopolies]]

## Connections to My Thinking
- Helps articulate why community-scale tech ([[Metalabel (Index)]],  [[Cooperativism-as-Ownership-Structure]]) matters politically.  [[cooperativism]]
- Offers a framework for rejecting extractive platforms (like [[platform monopolies]]) without requiring full revolutionary rupture.
- Deepens the concept of [[Community-Tech-Infrastructure]] by grounding it in autonomy, scale, and conviviality.
- Resonates with my emphasis on building alternatives rather than pursuing direct confrontation.
