What a weekend. We did it, though. We're in the new place. Fucking tired, the top sheet is bit weird. We might just replace it haha, not like our stuff is far. Definitely has AirBnb-core vibes, but we'll make it work. It's going to be nice to be so close to Ace Coffee, I imagine I'll be getting work done there (at least until I get frustrated with not having a second screen).

Oy, feeling tired. A bit discombobulated. Feels like there is a lot to do, and that I'm not quite prepared for this set.

## 📥 Processing Queue (pick 1! it won't hurt)
```dataview 
TABLE without id file.link as "Note", file.folder as "Location" FROM "Personal/70_Fleeting Notes" OR "Personal/50_Literature Notes" WHERE !contains(file.tags, "#done") AND !contains(file.tags, "#processed") AND status != "done" AND status != "processed" AND file.name !="_guide" SORT file.ctime ASC
```

**The "Definition of Done" Rule:** You are only allowed to add the `#processed` tag (or `status: done`) if you have done **at least one** of the following to that note:

1. **Created a Link:** You found a connection to another note (e.g., linking Mark Fischer to Anarchism).
2. **Extracted an Atomic Idea:** You wrote a _new_ Permanent Note based on a paragraph in the Literature Note.
3. **Refuted It:** You wrote a sentence explaining why you disagree with the note.
