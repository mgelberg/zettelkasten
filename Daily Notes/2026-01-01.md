Happy new year! it's snowing. Nice to see it coming down out here. We actually did end up staying up through the ball drop. Just enough. 

It's been nice having a dog next to me. Lola is sweet, and much more of a cuddler than I remember from the last time. Cute to be among a different family too, seeing their "customs" as it were.

It's a new year! What exciting things to come. I am trying to look at it as a bit of a refresh. Rather, it feels like a bit of a refresh, at least for now. Dry January will begin tomorrow.

## 📥 Processing Queue (pick 1! it won't hurt)
```dataview 
TABLE without id file.link as "Note", file.folder as "Location" FROM "Personal/70_Fleeting Notes" OR "Personal/50_Literature Notes" WHERE !contains(file.tags, "#done") AND !contains(file.tags, "#processed") AND status != "done" AND status != "processed" AND file.name !="_guide" SORT file.ctime ASC
```

**The "Definition of Done" Rule:** You are only allowed to add the `#processed` tag (or `status: done`) if you have done **at least one** of the following to that note:

1. **Created a Link:** You found a connection to another note (e.g., linking Mark Fischer to Anarchism).
2. **Extracted an Atomic Idea:** You wrote a _new_ Permanent Note based on a paragraph in the Literature Note.
3. **Refuted It:** You wrote a sentence explaining why you disagree with the note.
