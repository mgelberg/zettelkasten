Hello again. Well first thing I'll do is check my previous day's to do list. Thankfully I did everything but one, and even the one I missed was irrelevant, I wasn't going to waste my time dealing with shitty ChatGPT attempts at organizing my notes. That's a problem for a different day, and I did far more productive things with my note taking than that.

The party went well, didn't overdo it, socialized well, got good feedback. I'm proud of myself. Especially since I have shit to do this morning, including that [[Anastasia Kobekina]] presentation in an hour. I'm going to get to that, and also would like to make some updates to my vibe coding to have better git branching / integration.
