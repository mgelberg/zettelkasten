# Thoughts on Low Pass Event last night
- It really feels like the [[Sound House]] format is the winner, it's such a chill evening, moves people in and out through different sets, and easy enough set up since we're not having to break down / set-up the stage for each performance.
- I of course am doing the thing where I'm second guessing things I said / how I interacted. I was a bit stoned, but I don't think I said anything inappropriate. Just awkward things, or feeling the need to talk when I could have simply said nothing. Alas. I did switch up an XLR cable and power, that was pretty stoney.

## 📥 Processing Queue (pick 1! it won't hurt)
```dataview 
TABLE without id file.link as "Note", file.folder as "Location" FROM "Personal/70_Fleeting Notes" OR "Personal/50_Literature Notes" WHERE !contains(file.tags, "#done") AND !contains(file.tags, "#processed") AND status != "done" AND status != "processed" AND file.name !="_guide" SORT file.ctime ASC
```

**The "Definition of Done" Rule:** You are only allowed to add the `#processed` tag (or `status: done`) if you have done **at least one** of the following to that note:

1. **Created a Link:** You found a connection to another note (e.g., linking Mark Fischer to Anarchism).
2. **Extracted an Atomic Idea:** You wrote a _new_ Permanent Note based on a paragraph in the Literature Note.
3. **Refuted It:** You wrote a sentence explaining why you disagree with the note.
