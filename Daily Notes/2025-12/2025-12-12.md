Funny to have had a new discovery witht his Kompulusion seequencer after 10ish years. But I was trying to have a lane be dedicated to octave jumps, with no effect on the note itself, and I *think* I figured it out? The Mix tab seems to be simialr to the logic options of Pam's, but it looks like you can set it where the note value of another sequence replaces the note value of the octave sequence, I need to confirm. But interesting find.

Also, Titus is dying, but I'm not ready to talk about that yet.

## 📥 Processing Queue (pick 1! it won't hurt)
```dataview 
TABLE without id file.link as "Note", file.folder as "Location" FROM "Personal/70_Fleeting Notes" OR "Personal/50_Literature Notes" WHERE !contains(file.tags, "#done") AND !contains(file.tags, "#processed") AND status != "done" AND status != "processed" AND file.name !="_guide" SORT file.ctime ASC
```

**The "Definition of Done" Rule:** You are only allowed to add the `#processed` tag (or `status: done`) if you have done **at least one** of the following to that note:

1. **Created a Link:** You found a connection to another note (e.g., linking Mark Fischer to Anarchism).
2. **Extracted an Atomic Idea:** You wrote a _new_ Permanent Note based on a paragraph in the Literature Note.
3. **Refuted It:** You wrote a sentence explaining why you disagree with the note.
