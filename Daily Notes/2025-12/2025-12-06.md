# morning

The Low Pass event is tonight, so I’ll be joining that. It’s at that Calvary spot in West Philly, doing the Soundhouse kind of thing again.

I feel like the street sweeping is a funny time of year to see how far Ezra’s come since the previous one. He was partly interested in sweeping and helping clean today, but sharing is not so much a strong suit.

# 3:20pm

It's funny, had a though today that as I try to dive in more to this [[Zettelkasten]] stuff, I'm like, am I just going to be total recluse?

I think I still need to be better at defining what my goals are. I think first and foremost, it's about avoiding [[Passive Learning]], which I hope would be a muscle that can support me in many areas, including future career opportunities. Developing a true manifesto (that's not written by ChatGPT ffs), or at least a way I can define my ethos. Being able to really reference books I read and not lose my train of thought.
