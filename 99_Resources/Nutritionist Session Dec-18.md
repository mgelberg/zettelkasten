Thank you for meeting with me. Below are the goals and recommendations we discussed during our appointment.

Short-term goals

Incorporate balanced breakfast meals 4-5x per week See handout for recipe ideas. Use the MyPlate model for reference on building a balanced breakfast.

Visit Overview

We discussed the MyPlate model, emphasizing that half your plate should be filled with fruits and vegetables to help manage cholesterol.

The importance of lean protein sources and whole grains was highlighted to support fullness, muscle repair, and blood sugar balance.

We talked about how fiber can help reduce cholesterol and assist with weight management.

I educated you on the caloric density of fats and the need to moderate added fats from cooking oils and dressings.

We explored your current eating patterns and preferences to find practical meal substitutions, especially focusing on improving breakfast.

We set achievable goals to increase balanced breakfast meals to 4-5 days a week.

I encouraged meal prepping and using an app for food journaling with photos to help you stay on track.

We addressed barriers like time constraints and meal prep ease, and I offered to provide recipe ideas tailored to your taste and schedule.

You did a great job during our session by sharing your experiences and being open to new ideas. It's clear you're motivated to make positive changes!

Your next appointment is on Wed, Jan 7 at 12:00 PM EST.
