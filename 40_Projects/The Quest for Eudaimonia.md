A book club of sorts I'd like to start with Audrey.

To help you get your journey started, here are links to reliable, high-quality versions of the texts mentioned. Most of these are available via **Project Gutenberg** or **The Internet Classics Archive** (MIT), which provide clean, ad-free versions of public domain translations.

### 1. Aristotle: _Nicomachean Ethics_

- **The Text:** [Nicomachean Ethics - Full Text (Gutenberg)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/8438/8438-h/8438-h.htm)
    
- **Reading Guide:** Focus on **Book I** (for the definition of _Eudaimonia_) and **Book II** (for the "Golden Mean" and how to build habits of virtue).
    

### 2. The Stoics: Aurelius & Epictetus

- **Marcus Aurelius:** [_Meditations_ (MIT Classics)](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html)
    
    - _Tip:_ Start with **Book Two**; it’s where he moves from thanking his teachers to practical daily philosophy.
        
- **Epictetus:** [_The Enchiridion_ (Gutenberg)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45109/45109-h/45109-h.htm)
    
    - _Tip:_ This is a short "handbook."1 Read chapters 1–10 to get the core of his message about control and the "Good."
        

### 3. Epicurus: _Letter to Menoeceus_

- **The Text:** [Letter to Menoeceus (Columbia University PDF)](https://www.college.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Menoeceus.pdf)
    
- **Alternative:** [Reference Translation (New Epicurean)](https://newepicurean.com/epicurus/letter-to-menoeceus-reference-translation/)
    
    - _Tip:_ This is a relatively short letter where Epicurus clarifies that pleasure isn't "partying," but rather the absence of anxiety.
        

### 4. Plato: _The Republic_

- **The Text:** [_The Republic_ (MIT Classics)](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html)
    
- **Reading Guide:** * **Book VI:** Look for the "Sun Analogy" (the Form of the Good).
    
    - **Book VII:** This contains the **Allegory of the Cave**, the most famous passage about the journey toward truth.
        

### 5. Viktor Frankl: _Man’s Search for Meaning_

- **The Text:** [Man's Search for Meaning (Internet Archive)](https://archive.org/details/viktor-emil-frankl-mans-search-for-meaning)
    
    - _Note:_ Because this is a 20th-century text, it is not in the public domain in the same way as the ancients, but it is available to "borrow" digitally for free via the Internet Archive.
        

### Recommended Resource: The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)

If your group wants a "cliff-notes" version to read alongside the classics, the SEP is the gold standard for scholarly summaries:

- [Aristotle's Ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/)
    
- [Ancient Ethical Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/)
    

**Pro-Tip for the Group:** Since different translations use different terms (e.g., some use "Happiness," others "Flourishing," others "Well-being"), encourage everyone to use the same link or at least be aware that they are all translating the same Greek word: **_Eudaimonia_**.
