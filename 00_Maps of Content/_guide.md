Purpose:
High-level overview notes showing how clusters of ideas relate.
These are maps, not summaries.
They link outward and show structure, not definitions.

Use when:
	•	You want a bird’s-eye view
	•	You’re grouping concepts, thinkers, or projects
	•	You’re orienting yourself inside a topic
	•	You’re synthesizing multiple notes into a conceptual layout

Avoid:
	•	Writing content inside the MOC
	•	Turning it into an article or essay
	•	Explaining concepts in depth
