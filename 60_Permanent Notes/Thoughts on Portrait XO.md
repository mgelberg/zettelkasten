I read the synopsis of [[MUSIC X conversation with Portrait XO]] and would like to listen to the podcast, but this definitely resonates with a point that Audrey and I make with regards to how the "left" views AI. We have every right to be skeptical of it, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't *engage* with it, experiment with it, break it, refactor it, remix it.

> What we need is experiments and failures and iteration.

The smugness and dismissiveness I see with it is appalling and off-putting, every stereotype people feel about "coastal elites." It's hard to imagine these same people having the same feelings about the internet when it first came on, not in the sense that AI and the internet are synonymous, but that they are both new technologies that clearly will have a profound impact on society.

> Portrait XO’s belief that artists have a responsibility to engage critically with AI. She doesn’t denounce it wholesale _and_ doesn’t embrace it uncritically. Instead she participates in the difficult conversations about how it should be developed and used.

We can turn our noses up all we want, and pat ourselves on the back for not using chatGPT (oh cuz google is so much better, the *artisinal* brand, give me a fucking break), but if we don't get to participate in how this stuff is used, we're gonna be left behind, more neanderthal than luddite. So much for [[Community-Tech-Infrastructure]].
