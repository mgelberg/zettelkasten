## Cooperativism


_What is the structure or governance model that enacts the ethics of [[Mutualism (Index)]]?


You use cooperativism to discuss:

- ownership structures
- governance forms
- collective decision-making
- federation models
- platform alternatives
- economic design
    

Cooperativism = **institutional form / governance / infrastructure.**

They _relate_, but mutualism is the _spirit_, cooperativism is the _machinery_.
