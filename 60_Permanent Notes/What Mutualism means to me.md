### **Mutualism**

_What is the economic ethic behind the system?_

You use mutualism to talk about:

- reciprocal exchange
- non-extractive relationships
- shared benefit
- solidarity practices
- anti-competitive culture-building
- “hyping each other up” instead of hierarchy

Mutualism = **principle / ethics / value orientation.**
