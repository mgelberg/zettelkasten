Thinking about this article [[Suno and AI]] as it relates to [[Warner Music Group]] signing a deal. I'm still trying to understand what's in it for Suno, or what it means for their existing work. Is it just about having some legitimacy for deals with the other networks?

Fundamentally, I would love to understand what % of artists actually opt in. Is Warner going to play fair when it comes to ensuring that artists must explicitly "opt-in", or is it going to be something that they agree to opt into by default for new deals?
