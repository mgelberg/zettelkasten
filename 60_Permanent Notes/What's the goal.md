12/2 9:35pm, a bit stoned

To use notes with the [[Zettelkasten]] format to better organize my thoughts, help link ideas, avoid [[Passive Learning]], and really try to articulate my own voice.

A good example of something I'm a bit frustrated about is that at the beginning of this year, I was voraciously reading books about topics ranging from [[Anarchism]] and [[pre-figuration]] to philosophies around [[Phenomenology]]  (my therapist introduced me to [[Heidegger]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] and then more modern thinkers like [[Mark Fischer]], but aside from some tipsy or over-caffeinated conversations I had with ChatGPT, a lot of that didn't stick and I didn't have a way of *expanding* upon those thoughts.

I certainly had plenty of conversations with Audrey and whoever else would listen, which were also helpful with articulating a voice, but nothing was saved for posterity.

I am someone who has always been obsessed with the benefits of *retaining* as much as possible of my archives, so to speak, and I think I always saw the promise of the internet / cloud computing / etc. was the idea that this wouldn't be something that would take up physical space. As alluring as the image is of the academic buried in books and manuscripts, that always seemed like a nightmare to me.

However, there's no value in having all these notes in Evernote or chats with AI if I'm never revisiting them. If they're just sitting there unused, or worse, it's the same [[Eurorack]] note that I've had to look up 800x times. Well, maybe not worse. I don't know, what I'm trying to say is that **digital clutter** is a thing too. And if I want to actually have a viewpoint, I think it'd be good to find a way to link thoughts and make it a practice.
