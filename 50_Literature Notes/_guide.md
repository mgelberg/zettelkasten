**Purpose:**
Notes derived from a source.
This is your “Literature Notes” layer — not your ideas yet.

**Use when:**
	•	You’re pulling information straight from a book, interview, or article
	•	You want to capture direct quotes
	•	You want raw material to synthesize later

**Avoid:**
	•	Putting your own ideas here (those go in Permanent Notes)
	•	Summaries longer than needed
