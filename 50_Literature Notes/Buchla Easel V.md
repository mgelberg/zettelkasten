# What inspired you to write this note?
- I've been really fixated on [[low pass gate]] stuff for some reason, and figured this would be a good modular to explore


# Manual Notes
### I/O
- for the pulser, oscillators, and Dual LPG, the slider to the right controls the parameter, and the one to the left is the CV modulation amount
- outputs can be patched up to three times
- follow the colors!
## Modulators
- Think of the Pulser like an AD, but it can be super quick, and used as a trigger source
- Pulser Modes
	- Sync: forces periods to be syncecd musically
	- Free: period can be set arbitrarily
		- Clock: triggered by the clock (overrides the Trigger Select)
