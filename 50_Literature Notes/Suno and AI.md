[On… Suno, Songkick, and a Reddit Revolt - Music Business Worldwide](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/on-suno-songkick-and-a-reddit-revolt/)

Last week, we saw the result: **WMG** [settled](https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?e=cab30b8675&u=1cea3abb6ec1d881feba0c654&id=62387bbc72#:~:text=last%20week%3A%20WMG-,dropped,-its%20lawsuit%20against) its lawsuit with **Suno**, inked a **licensing deal**, and will start getting paid when its catalog is used to train the platform’s models.

**WMG** artists and writers get **opt-in control**; royalties will flow from whatever hits might emerge.

This is a significant moment. The leading generative AI music platform — with [100 million+ users](https://suno.com/blog/wmg-partnership) — has accepted a core principle: **training data must be licensed and paid for.**
