“Elsewhere in the conversation, Portrait XO’s spoke about music and AI as an ecology, or a complex system of relationships, dependencies, and feedback loops. In ecological terms, what we’re seeing is an invasive species introduced into an already stressed ecosystem. The music industry was struggling before AI. Streaming economics don’t work for most artists. Discovery is broken. Power is concentrated among a few platforms. The introduction of GenAI only served to amplify these existing problems while creating new ones.

But ecological thinking also suggests paths forward. Healthy ecosystems are diverse, resilient, and adaptive. They have checks and balances. They distribute resources in ways that sustain the whole system, not just the dominant players. Applying this to music and AI means building infrastructure that supports diversity rather than homogeneity. It should be all about feedback loops that reward quality and cultural value over mere volume. Of course, accounting for externalities like environmental sustainability and cultural impact.

This isn’t utopian thinking. It’s practical systems design. As we’ve discussed throughout these podcast conversations, the current systems aren’t working. We have an opportunity and even an obligation to build better one”
